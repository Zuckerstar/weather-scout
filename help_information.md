## Home/Map Page
The map page allows for both visual exploration by **moving around the map** or search based exploration by **entering a location in the search bar** (located on the upper left part of the screen). On this screen **please select a destination** by clicking anywhere on the map (that is NOT a green or blue circle) or by searching a location, and a green icon will be dropped on the best estimate for the location you are searching for.

Once a destination is set, the **nearest weather station is automatically selected and indicated by a light blue icon**. If the weather station is on a dark blue circle, then daily weather data is available. A bright green circle indicates that hourly information is available in addition to the daily data (however daily data is the default selected on future screens). You may change the weather station by clicking another circle (commonly done to pick a station further away but at a higher elevation, making a better comparison to your destination).

**Once you have selected a destination and a weather station to use, proceed to the next tab (Quick Data).**

## Quick Data
The quick data tab **shows the estimated temperature high/low values for your destination over the next eight weeks**. It is important to note that all temperature data is based on long-term historical climate data studies and is NOT a short-term/likely forecast, **this should be used for long term planning ONLY**.

Changing the Start Date select box will determine the first of the eight week periods displayed below (e.g., choosing Jan 1st would show the first eight weeks of the year). If hourly weather data is available at the chosen weather station, then you can switch to hourly data using the Data Frequency select box.

Automatically the application determines the elevation of your destination and a selected weather station to compute the elevation differential of the two. **By default for every 1,000ft lower the weather station is from your destination, 3.57 degrees Fahrenheit will be lowered from the estimated temperature**. This is a good rule of thumb number but can be changed with the input box on the right. If you know your environment will by dry then closer to 5 degrees may be appropriate, conversly if it is quite humid then close to 2 degrees might be better.

Clicking the Show High/Low Ranges box enabled "error bands" around the high and low temperature, each showing the 70% most likely max and min temperatures on any given day in that week. For example, if set to the beginning of August and the top of the grey error bands spans from 85-100 degrees, then 70% of the time the high temperature will be between 85 and 100 degrees in the first week of August.

## Time Data
The time data tab shows more advanced analytics daily over a more extended period then displayed in the quick data tab. For every day, the mean high, average, and low temperatures are represented by a dot on the graph. For each of these data points, the colored area represents the 70% most likely temperature ranges. Note you can adjust the start and end dates of the graph with the inputs at the top of the page.
