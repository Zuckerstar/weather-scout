# Welcome to Weather Scout

## The Problem
Every ten years NOAA creates an incredible climate data set based on the past 30 years of historical data. Despite containing valuable information in the dataset, the current access tools are incredibly challenging to use, which prevents exploration.

## The Solution
This website combines an interactive map with a powerful location search tool, the NOAA Climate Normals dataset and some prediction techniques to create a rich exploration of what temperatures **might** be at any location in the United States at different points during the year
**Note: This information is based on historical weather data and is NOT a prediction of future weather patterns, please check a short-term forcast at [weather.gov](http://www.weather.gov) before heading out on a trip).**

## About Me
My name is Trevor Nederlof, and I happen to love data science, web application development, and ultralight backpacking. Finding what the likely weather was for locations that I had no primary knowledge about for upcoming trips months away was always a tough problem to solve, and it involved a decent amount of uncertainty. Being an ultralight backpacker who hates packing extra things in the pack "just in case", this was frustrating as I would end up experiencing conditions way different than I expected and have the wrong gear ready for the trip.

In 2019 I decided to sit down and start building this application as a useful tool to explore rich weather data for myself, the ultralight backpacking community, and beyond. Data and the outdoors are my two greatest passions, I would love to continue to add features and make this as useful to you as possible so please don't hesitate to give feedback, suggest new features and ask away with questions at the link below.
